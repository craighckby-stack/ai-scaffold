# Changelog

All notable changes to Dalek Linear Evolution will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Specialized architecture analysis modules (e.g., serverless, microservices).
- Quantum computing readiness check for evolved code structures.
- Automated code migration path suggestions (e.g., Python 2 -> 3 transition optimization).
- Integrated cost-benefit analysis for suggested optimizations.

## [19.0.0] - 2025-03-15

### Added
- **Hyper-Optimization Engine (HOE):** A dedicated analysis pipeline focused on micro-optimization suggestions (e.g., loop unwrapping, constant folding).
- **Asynchronous Parallel Evolution:** Allows simultaneous evaluation of multiple potential evolution paths, significantly reducing overall cycle time.
- **Local Caching Layer:** Caches expensive AI analysis results and repository metadata, improving response and iteration speeds by up to 60%.
- **Streaming AI Response:** Switched from batch processing to streaming outputs for Gemini analysis, enabling real-time feedback during evolution steps.
- Deep static analysis integration for early memory leakage and resource mismanagement detection.

### Features
- Dalek-level performance metrics reporting (Cycle Time, Resource Consumption Delta).
- Automatic dependency injection optimization suggestions.
- Enhanced intelligent bug detection focusing on runtime efficiency losses.
- Optimized commit generation supporting squash and rebase strategies for cleaner history.

### Technical
- Migration to Firebase v9 Modular SDK for superior tree-shaking and load performance.
- Adoption of GitHub REST API v4 (GraphQL) for faster, targeted data retrieval and reduced overhead.
- Implementation of Web Workers for background processing, ensuring UI responsiveness during heavy analysis.
- Optimized bundle size via aggressive compression and advanced code-splitting techniques.
